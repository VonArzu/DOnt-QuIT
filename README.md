## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of and a brief description.  

```
Goals:
happyButton = () =>{
document.querySelector('.happy').onClick('randomQoute');
}
```

## Change Log
I deleted the emojis on each button because it was not aesthetically pleasing to the eye. It was ugly and took way too much time to crop to circles to fit each button. 

I also deleted "|July 15| Let API reset after each button clicked again  | Incomplete" because it was no difference in ther fetch API. There are over 1600 quotes and a new one comes up everytime. No need for a reset.

Added new "Remove & Repeat Fetch API after each button clicked again " so users can receive new quotes without the quotes blocking the page or having an overload of quotes on the page.
